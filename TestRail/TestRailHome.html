                    <p><em>This is a guest post by Cameron Laird.</em></p>
                    <p>Software organizations frequently talk and think in terms of priorities, with fine distinctions
                        about
                        urgency, importance, precedence, severity, feasibility, and so on. Testing has its priorities
                        too,
                        and
                        while these priorities should be related to those of other departments, they are distinct.
                    </p>
                    <p> By understanding clearly how priorities operate in testing, everyone can make the most of the
                        effort
                        there.</p>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>Advocate for testing</h1>
                    <p>Testing’s very first priority isn’t technical, isn’t focused on the user experience, and has
                        little
                        to do
                        with automation and computing expertise.</p>
                    <p>Testing’s first priority is to set clear expectations with other departments — and live up to
                        them.
                    </p>
                    <p>An important part of that latter notion of accountability is communicating when other departments
                        are
                        and
                        aren’t meeting their own commitments. Sometimes that means reporting the discovery of a gap in
                        existing
                        test plans; sometimes it means telling the team that a calendar isn’t realistic and needs to be
                        adjusted; sometimes it even means letting everyone know a testing sequence is ahead of schedule
                        and
                        deserves releveling. In any case, testing does best by establishing itself as a full and trusted
                        team
                        member, communicating effectively and professionally about business values as well as technical
                        ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>A second priority for the testing department is advocacy — that is, the presentation of the
                        business
                        value of testing. Organizations often think they can skimp on testing. When a delivery is
                        missing
                        its
                        deadlines, one of the most common reactions is to compress the schedule for testing that
                        delivery.
                        When
                        things are going well and customers are happy with a product or service, it’s almost equally
                        tempting to
                        conclude that testing is more cost than benefit, and erode the attention and resources, and time
                        allowed
                        for testing.</p>
                    <p>Testing always needs a strong internal voice to express the value a professional testing program
                        brings
                        to products and services. Only the testing department itself has the background and experience
                        to
                        communicate that truth, so a necessary priority is to remind the whole team of testing’s
                        benefits.
                    </p>
                    <p>Similarly, the testing department itself is best situated to judge the sustainability of its
                        activities
                        and how to enhance them. Are testers expected to work on weekends, to help compensate for
                        slipped
                        schedules? Does the organization grade testing careers as junior or inferior? Does it train
                        programmers,
                        sales staff, or marketers to stay current with their technologies, but skimp on training
                        testers?
                        Does
                        the organization appear to believe that it accelerates completion by adding staff late in a
                        campaign?
                    </p>
                    <p>All those choices communicate that testing staff is more like consumable commodities to be used
                        up and discarded than expert investments to be cultivated. Learn negotiation techniques and help
                        the
                        organization better care for its valuable testing staff.</p>
                    <p>For example, if testing is told that they need to work extra or shifted hours in order to meet a
                        deadline, respond professionally by agreeing with the condition that at least one of the
                        following
                        requests be met:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Testing will receive appropriate compensatory time off afterward</li>
                        <li>Testing will get subsidies for commuting, home technology purchases or training
                            opportunities
                        </li>
                        <li>The next budget will increase the size of the testing department</li>
                        <li>Another reasonable, specific, meaningful recognition that the test team be managed
                            sustainably,
                            rather than worked until they burn out</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>Sharpen your axes</h1>
                    <p>The priorities above focus on how the testing team operates systemically within an organization.
                        A
                        good
                        testing department needs that kind of vision and execution. It simultaneously needs to balance
                        strategic
                        engagement with the trustworthy execution of testing activities.</p>
                    <p>The third priority is to sharpen axes — that is, ensure that all your testing tools are in shape
                        before
                        testing starts.</p>
                    <p>Does your staff have all the licenses, modern equipment, network connectivity, test data sets,
                        and so
                        on
                        that are needed, so they can concentrate on testing rather than struggle with limitations of
                        insufficient tools? Do your testers spend time on boilerplate or administrative chores or
                        bureaucratic
                        workarounds that can be streamlined or automated?</p>
                    <p>Identifying and resolving these areas for improvement is one of the best ways to increase
                        velocity
                        and
                        finish assignments quicker.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>Documentation is automation</h1>
                    <p>Another evergreen priority is to document your testing work.</p>
                    <p>Documentation becomes an asset for future assignments because it minimizes rediscovery of all
                        that
                        slows
                        you when you first undertake a task. This kind of documentation also helps communicate to
                        decision-makers and other departments the specific details that promote understanding of the
                        value
                        of
                        testing</p>
                    <p>Read Tom Limoncelli’s classic article “Documentation Is Automation” for further inspiration.
                        Notice
                        particularly his emphasis that documentation is progressive, an iterative undertaking to which
                        we
                        return
                        through time as we gain understanding and as our circumstances shift.</p>

                    <h1>Focus on your own work</h1>
                    <p>Finally, as in any list of priorities, recognize that reverse engineering is an anti-priority.
                        More
                        specifically, testing should never have to analyze how an application works to determine why it
                        works as
                        it does.</p>
                    <p>Insist on specific requirements for each object tested. In the absence of explicit
                        specifications,
                        it’s
                        more honest to report simply that the software meets its non-existent requirements than to
                        speculate
                        about what product management or other decision-makers intend for the software. Testers might
                        still
                        occasionally lean on reverse engineering to suggest useful test values, but leave requirements
                        synthesis
                        to those who deserve this responsibility.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>Any testing you do ought to start with this outline of priorities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Set clear expectations between testing and other departments</li>
                        <li>Advocate for the business value of testing</li>
                        <li>Communicate with the team</li>
                        <li>Ensure tools are ready for action</li>
                        <li>Document findings and techniques</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Get these right, and your tests will be well on the road to success.</p>
